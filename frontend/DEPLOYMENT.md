# Netlify Deployment Guide

## What was fixed

The 404 "Page not found" error was caused by client-side routing in your React app. When users visit routes like `/about` directly, Netlify looks for a file at that path, but since it's a client-side route handled by React Router, the file doesn't exist.

## Files created/modified

1. **`public/_redirects`** - Tells Netlify to serve `index.html` for all routes
2. **`public/_headers`** - Adds security headers and tests if Netlify is reading public files
3. **`netlify.toml`** - Netlify configuration file
4. **`package.json`** - Updated build script to use Vite's default output directory
5. **`vite.config.ts`** - Updated to ensure proper build configuration

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push your changes to GitHub** (including the new files)
2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose your repository
   - Set build command: `npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `dist`
   - Click "Deploy site"

## Build Configuration

- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist` (Vite's default output)
- **Node version**: 18 (specified in netlify.toml)

## How the fix works

The `_redirects` file tells Netlify to serve `index.html` for all routes (`/*`), allowing React Router to handle client-side routing. The `netlify.toml` file provides additional configuration and ensures the redirects are properly applied.

## Troubleshooting

If you still get 404 errors:

1. **Verify build output**: Make sure the `_redirects` and `_headers` files are in the `dist` folder after building
2. **Check file locations**:
   - `_redirects` and `_headers` should be in the `public` folder (source)
   - They should automatically copy to the `dist` folder during build
3. **Netlify configuration**: Verify the `netlify.toml` file is in the root of your frontend folder
4. **Build settings**: In Netlify dashboard, ensure:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
5. **Check redirects**: In Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Post processing > Asset optimization
6. **Clear cache**: Sometimes Netlify caches old redirects - try clearing the cache or redeploying

## Common Issues

- **Wrong publish directory**: Make sure it's `dist`, not `build`
- **Missing \_redirects**: The file must be in the `public` folder to be copied during build
- **Build failures**: Check the build logs in Netlify for any errors
- **Cached redirects**: Netlify sometimes caches old redirect rules - redeploy or clear cache
