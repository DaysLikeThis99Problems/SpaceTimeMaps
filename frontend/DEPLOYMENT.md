# Netlify Deployment Guide

## What was fixed

The 404 "Page not found" error was caused by several configuration issues:

1. **Mixed build system**: Your project had both Create React App and Vite configurations, causing conflicts
2. **Client-side routing**: React Router routes weren't being handled properly by Netlify
3. **Missing redirects**: Netlify didn't know how to handle client-side routes
4. **Vercel configuration**: The project was originally configured for Vercel, not Netlify
5. **Build context**: Netlify couldn't find package.json due to incorrect build directory configuration

## Files created/modified

1. **`public/_redirects`** - Tells Netlify to serve `index.html` for all routes
2. **`public/_headers`** - Adds security headers and tests if Netlify is reading public files
3. **`netlify.toml`** - Netlify configuration file (both in frontend/ and root)
4. **`.nvmrc`** - Specifies Node.js version for Netlify builds
5. **`package.json`** - Cleaned up dependencies and scripts for Vite-only build
6. **`vite.config.ts`** - Updated to ensure proper build configuration and public file handling
7. **Removed**: `vercel.json`, `reportWebVitals.ts`, `setupTests.ts` (Create React App remnants)

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push your changes to GitHub** (including the new files)
2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose your repository
   - Set build command: `npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `dist`
   - Click "Deploy site"

## Build Configuration

- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist` (Vite's default output)
- **Base directory**: `frontend` (where package.json is located)
- **Node version**: 18 (specified in netlify.toml and .nvmrc)

## How the fix works

1. **Clean Vite build**: Removed all Create React App dependencies and configurations that were conflicting with Vite
2. **Proper redirects**: The `_redirects` file tells Netlify to serve `index.html` for all routes (`/*`), allowing React Router to handle client-side routing
3. **Netlify configuration**: The `netlify.toml` file specifies the correct build settings and publish directory
4. **Public file handling**: Vite is configured to properly copy `_redirects` and `_headers` files to the build output

## What was cleaned up

- Removed `react-scripts` and Create React App dependencies
- Removed `vercel.json` (Vercel-specific configuration)
- Removed `reportWebVitals.ts` and `setupTests.ts` (Create React App files)
- Cleaned up `package.json` to use only Vite-related dependencies
- Updated build scripts to be Vite-specific

## Troubleshooting

### 404 Errors

If you still get 404 errors:

1. **Verify build output**: Make sure the `_redirects` and `_headers` files are in the `dist` folder after building
2. **Check file locations**:
   - `_redirects` and `_headers` should be in the `public` folder (source)
   - They should automatically copy to the `dist` folder during build
3. **Netlify configuration**: Verify the `netlify.toml` file is in the root of your frontend folder
4. **Build settings**: In Netlify dashboard, ensure:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
5. **Check redirects**: In Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Post processing > Asset optimization
6. **Clear cache**: Sometimes Netlify caches old redirects - try clearing the cache or redeploying

### Package.json Not Found Error

If you get "package.json not found" errors during build:

1. **Check base directory**: Ensure `netlify.toml` has `base = "frontend"`
2. **Repository structure**: Verify your repository has the frontend folder at the root level
3. **File location**: Make sure `package.json` is in the `frontend/` directory
4. **Root netlify.toml**: There should be a `netlify.toml` file in both the root and frontend directories
5. **Build logs**: Check Netlify build logs to see which directory it's trying to build from

## Common Issues

- **Wrong publish directory**: Make sure it's `dist`, not `build`
- **Missing \_redirects**: The file must be in the `public` folder to be copied during build
- **Build failures**: Check the build logs in Netlify for any errors
- **Cached redirects**: Netlify sometimes caches old redirect rules - redeploy or clear cache
- **Mixed build systems**: Don't mix Create React App and Vite configurations
- **Vercel vs Netlify**: Remove `vercel.json` when deploying to Netlify
- **Dependency conflicts**: Ensure all dependencies are compatible with your build system
